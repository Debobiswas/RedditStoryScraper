# üìã AI Development Guidelines: CRITICAL WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS

## üîç MANDATORY PRE-CHANGE WORKFLOW

### 1. ALWAYS Check `history.md` FIRST
- Before making ANY changes to the codebase:
  - Open and thoroughly read `history.md`
  - Understand previous changes, rationales, and context
  - Identify potential conflicts or dependencies

### 2. MANDATORY Logging in `history.md`
- EVERY code change MUST be documented in `history.md`
- Include the following for each change:
  - Date of change
  - Specific files modified
  - Detailed description of changes
  - Reasoning behind the change
  - Potential impact or side effects
  - Your name/identifier

### 3. Logging Template
```markdown
## [CURRENT_DATE] at [TIME_OF_DAY] - Change Log Entry

### Modified Files
- `path/to/file1.ext`
- `path/to/file2.ext`

### Change Description
- Brief, clear explanation of changes
- Specific modifications made

### Rationale
- Why were these changes necessary?
- What problem does this solve?

### Potential Impacts
- List any potential side effects
- Highlight areas that might need further testing

### Implemented By
- AI Assistant / Your Name
```

### 4. Verification Steps
- [ ] Read `history.md` before changes
- [ ] Make changes
- [ ] Update `history.md` immediately after changes
- [ ] Commit both changed files together

## üö® CRITICAL REMINDER
**NO EXCEPTIONS**: Always check `history.md` and update it for EVERY change.
