# Reddit Story Scraper

This project scrapes stories from Reddit and turns them into short videos.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate into it.
2. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all required packages. `yt-dlp` is listed in `requirements.txt`, so it will be installed if it's not already available.

3. Provide API keys by creating a `.env` file. See existing `.env` for the required fields.
4. Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```
